# Introduction

This document outlines the overall project architecture for **Promo Load Analyzer**, including backend systems, shared services, and non-UI specific concerns. Its primary goal is to serve as the guiding architectural blueprint for AI-driven development, ensuring consistency and adherence to chosen patterns and technologies.

**Relationship to Frontend Architecture:**
This project has NO traditional frontend UI. The interface is Claude Code's natural language processing. All user interactions occur through conversational commands. Therefore, no separate Frontend Architecture Document is needed.

## Starter Template or Existing Project

**N/A** - This is a greenfield Python CLI project. No starter template is used. The project will be built from scratch using Python 3.11+ with standard tooling (pip, virtualenv).
