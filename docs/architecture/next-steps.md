# Next Steps

## For Product Owner
1. Review this architecture document
2. Run master checklist to validate alignment with PRD
3. Approve or request changes
4. Proceed with story implementation once approved

## For Development Team
1. Setup development environment (`./scripts/setup_dev.sh`)
2. Begin implementation following architecture and coding standards
3. Start with core modules (page_detector, k6_generator, results_analyzer)
4. Write unit tests alongside development (TDD encouraged)
5. Integration test on PREPROD frequently

## Implementation Priority

**Phase 1 - MVP (< 2 weeks):**
1. Page detection (regex patterns)
2. Basic promo scraping (Playwright)
3. K6 script generation with safety thresholds
4. K6 execution and results parsing
5. Scoring and recommendation engine
6. PROD safety validation
7. End-to-end testing on PREPROD

**Phase 2 - Post Black Friday:**
- Real-time dashboard (InfluxDB + Grafana)
- Automated testing (GitHub Actions CI/CD)
- Enhanced analytics
- Performance optimizations
